Privacy Policy for BETWEEN
Last Updated: February 19, 2026

Overview
BETWEEN ("the App") is developed by Trevor Lawrence. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.

Information We Collect
Account Information
When you sign in with Apple, we receive a unique anonymous identifier. We do not receive or store your name, email address, or Apple ID password.

Conversation Text
When you upload screenshots or paste text for analysis, the text is processed as follows:

Screenshots are scanned on your device using optical character recognition (OCR). The screenshot images never leave your device and are not transmitted to any server.

Extracted text is sent from your device to our secure Firebase server (operated by Google LLC), which then forwards the text to Google's Gemini AI service for analysis. The Gemini AI service processes the text to generate conversation analysis results including a safety score, behavioral classification, verdict, and personality traits.

Important: The conversation text is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers or by the Gemini AI service after the analysis is complete. No conversation data is retained after your results are delivered.

Usage Data
We track the number of analyses you perform per day to enforce usage limits. This data is associated with your anonymous user ID and includes only a count and date — not the content of your conversations.

How We Use Your Information
We use your information solely for the following purposes:

To provide conversation analysis results by sending extracted text to Google's Gemini AI service for processing.

To enforce daily usage limits using anonymous usage counts.

To authenticate your access to the App via Sign in with Apple.

Third-Party Services and Data Sharing
The App shares data with the following third-party services:

Google's Gemini AI (Google LLC) — Conversation text that you submit for analysis is sent to Google's Gemini AI service for processing. Google processes this text to generate your analysis results. Google's handling of this data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy and their Generative AI Terms of Service.

Firebase Authentication (Google LLC) — Used for user sign-in and authentication.

Firebase Cloud Functions (Google LLC) — Used for secure server-side processing of analysis requests.

Firebase Firestore (Google LLC) — Used for storing anonymous usage counts only.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any other third parties for advertising, marketing, or any other purpose.

User Consent
Before your first analysis, the App presents a clear disclosure explaining what data is sent, who receives it, and how it is handled. You must explicitly agree to this data handling before any conversation text is transmitted from your device. You may decline, in which case no data will be sent.

Data Retention
Conversation text: Not retained. Processed in real-time and discarded immediately after analysis by both our server and the Gemini AI service.

Usage counts: Reset daily. Historical usage data is not retained.

Account data: Your anonymous identifier is retained as long as your account exists.

Data Security
We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS), server-side API key management (your device never has direct access to AI services), and Firebase Authentication tokens for secure access.

Your Rights
You have the right to delete your account and all associated data by contacting us, decline to share your email when signing in with Apple, withdraw your consent for data processing at any time, and stop using the App at any time.

Children's Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

Disclaimer
BETWEEN provides conversation analysis for informational and entertainment purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional psychological, legal, or medical advice. Analysis results are generated by artificial intelligence and should not be relied upon as definitive assessments of any individual's character or intentions.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date above.
