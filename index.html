<h1>Privacy Policy for BETWEEN</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: February 17, 2026</strong></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>BETWEEN ("the App") is developed by Trevor Lawrence. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>When you sign in with Apple, we receive a unique anonymous identifier. We do not receive or store your name, email address, or Apple ID password.</p>

<h3>Conversation Text</h3>
<p>When you upload screenshots or paste text for analysis, the text is processed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Screenshots</strong> are scanned on your device using optical character recognition (OCR). The images never leave your device.</p>
<p><strong>Extracted text</strong> is sent to our secure server for analysis using Google's Gemini AI. The text is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers after the analysis is complete.</p>

<h3>Usage Data</h3>
<p>We track the number of analyses you perform per day to enforce usage limits. This data is associated with your anonymous user ID and includes only a count and date — not the content of your conversations.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>To provide conversation analysis results, to enforce daily usage limits, and to authenticate your access to the App.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Functions, Firebase Firestore, and Google Gemini AI — all operated by Google LLC and governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p><strong>Conversation text:</strong> Not retained. Processed in real-time and discarded immediately after analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Usage counts:</strong> Reset daily. Historical usage data is not retained.</p>
<p><strong>Account data:</strong> Your anonymous identifier is retained as long as your account exists.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS), server-side API key management, and Firebase Authentication tokens for secure access.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to delete your account and all associated data by contacting us, decline to share your email when signing in with Apple, and stop using the App at any time.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>BETWEEN provides conversation analysis for <strong>informational and entertainment purposes only</strong>. It is not a substitute for professional psychological, legal, or medical advice.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date above.</p>
