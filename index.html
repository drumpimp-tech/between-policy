# Privacy Policy for BETWEEN

**Last Updated: February 17, 2026**

## Overview

BETWEEN ("the App") is developed by Trevor Lawrence. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information
When you sign in with Apple, we receive a unique anonymous identifier. We do not receive or store your name, email address, or Apple ID password. Apple may provide your email address if you choose to share it, but this is optional.

### Conversation Text
When you upload screenshots or paste text for analysis, the text is processed as follows:
- **Screenshots** are scanned on your device using optical character recognition (OCR). The images never leave your device.
- **Extracted text** is sent to our secure server for analysis using Google's Gemini AI. The text is processed in real-time and is **not stored** on our servers after the analysis is complete.

### Usage Data
We track the number of analyses you perform per day to enforce usage limits. This data is associated with your anonymous user ID and includes only a count and date — not the content of your conversations.

## How We Use Your Information

- To provide conversation analysis results
- To enforce daily usage limits
- To authenticate your access to the App

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

- **Firebase Authentication** (Google LLC) — for user sign-in and authentication
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** (Google LLC) — for secure server-side processing
- **Firebase Firestore** (Google LLC) — for storing usage counts
- **Google Gemini AI** (Google LLC) — for analyzing conversation text

These services are governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Retention

- **Conversation text**: Not retained. Processed in real-time and discarded immediately after analysis.
- **Usage counts**: Reset daily. Historical usage data is not retained.
- **Account data**: Your anonymous identifier is retained as long as your account exists. You may delete your account at any time.

## Data Security

We use industry-standard security measures including:
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Server-side API key management (your device never has direct access to AI services)
- Firebase Authentication tokens for secure access

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Delete your account** and all associated data by contacting us
- **Decline to share your email** when signing in with Apple
- **Stop using the App** at any time, after which no further data will be collected

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Disclaimer

BETWEEN provides conversation analysis for **informational and entertainment purposes only**. It is not a substitute for professional psychological, legal, or medical advice. Analysis results are generated by artificial intelligence and should not be relied upon as definitive assessments of any individual's character or intentions.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes through the App or by updating the "Last Updated" date above.
